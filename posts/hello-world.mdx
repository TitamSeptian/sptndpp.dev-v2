I first got to know about computers in 2006, on an island in eastern Indonesia, where technology was quite scarce. My parents had an old computer with limited internet access through a telephone cable. Despite the limitations, I explored the computer world by playing games like Spider Solitaire, Virtual Cop 2, and Beach Head 2002. Back then, my parents mentioned that internet access was too expensive. However, everything changed when I moved to Yogyakarta in 2008. There, I rediscovered computers and had easier internet access through the booming internet cafes.

In 2012, my interest in the internet grew as I became involved in a programming community. I started to understand how the internet operates and actively participated in web programming, creating my first program using Visual Basic 6.0[^1]. Over time, I delved deeper into web programming using PHP[^2]. Engaging in the development of a social media management system, I grasped the complexities of programming. Concurrently, I began writing on a blog with the aim of getting AdSense[^3].

In 2014, I shifted from programming to graphic design, participating in online logo contests and winning a few times. However, the call of programming echoed back in 2018 when I won a district-level programming competition. After graduating from vocational school, I pursued higher education at Amikom University of Yogyakarta, combining my experiences in graphic design and programming. I even successfully completed my thesis titled "Application of Personal Extreme Programming on The Design of The Sales Information System Application of The Lepas Rindu Coffee Shop Using Laravel".

Currently, I working for some freelance projects and my focus is on expanding my understanding of new programming languages like Golang and React. My personal website, built using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, is inspired by [Nev](https://nevflynn.com), which I find really cool. Maybe I'll write some articles in this personal website, stay tune!

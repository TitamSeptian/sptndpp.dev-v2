# About Me
I'm a DevOps Engineer specializing in cloud infrastructure, automation, and backend development. I have experience working with Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, and various cloud platforms like Google Cloud and AWS.

I'm a problem-solver who enjoys optimizing systems for performance, scalability, and reliability. I often collaborate with developers and engineering teams to build efficient CI/CD pipelines and cloud-native architectures.

While I enjoy working with teams, helping others, and learning new technologies, I also have a passion for writing and sharing my knowledge with the community. I write technical articles, tutorials, and guides on my blog.

When I'm not working or outside office hours, I love exploring new tech stacks or on lazy time playing online games or watching movies but mostly I'm spending time with my close friend

Reach me anytime i have a flexible work schedule, often working beyond traditional office hours.

This project started when I wanted to enhance my skills in using Laravel as a framework. I created this personal project by watching videos from one of my favorite web courses, namely Parsinta. In this project, I used Midtrans as the Payment Gateway, Inertia as the bridge between Laravel and React, React as the frontend library, and TailwindCSS for styling. This project is open-source, so if you're interested in contributing, feel free to fork and submit your pull requests.

Back then, my family lived in the eastern part of Indonesia, specifically on the Yapen Islands. In the early days of 2006, I was introduced to computers because my parents had an old tube computer. The area we lived in had limited internet access, and to get online, we had to connect the computer to the internet using a telephone cable. So, during that time, I mainly used it to play offline games because my parents mentioned that internet access was quite expensive.

In 2008, I had to move to Yogyakarta. It wasn't until 2014 that I got back to using a computer, this time with easier internet access due to the popularity of internet cafes. It was during this period that I started understanding how the internet works and became active in an online community focused on programming. I began creating simple programs using Visual Basic 6.0, such as a form that could be forwarded via email. That's when I became interested in web programming and got acquainted with PHP language through some individuals who invited me to develop a social media management system. Concurrently, I began writing on a blog with the aim of getting AdSense.

In 2014, I shifted from programming to graphic design. I participated in several logo design contests on freelance websites, and won a few, but not many. I also took on design projects for friends. In 2018, my teacher asks me to enter a district-level programming competition and secured second position and take a long break from programming. After graduating from vocational school, I chose Amikom University Yogyakarta because of my basic computer skills. Despite the busy college life, I rediscovered my passion for programming with the support of my classmates. I even successfully completed my thesis titled "Application of Personal Extreme Programming on The Design of The Sales Information System Application of The Lepas Rindu Coffee Shop Using Laravel".

Currently, I am working on some freelance projects and my focus is on expanding my understanding of new programming languages like Golang and React. Behind my personal website, which I built using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, I'm looking for references with bento grid layouts, and I came across <a href='https://nevflynn.com' target="_blank" rel='nofollow noreferrer noopener'>Nev</a>'s personal website, which I find really cool.
